== Simple C program structure

All the source code written in C is organized in *functions*

[.Program in C]
[source,c]
----
int main() {
  variable_declarations;
  expressions;
}
----

== C Functions

- `main` - C *main* function
- In parentheses `()` we put the input arguments 
- The return type of the functions is before the name
(`int` – the function returns integer)
- The function body starts with `{`, and ends with `}`
- All declarations and expressions are separated with `;`

== Comments usage

Comments are used for extra explanation or documenting the source code.
C supports two types of comments:

- one line comments that start with double slash `//`
----
// comment in one line
----

- multiple line comments that can span across multiple lines and start with
`/\*` and end with `*/`
----
/*
Longer comment
in multiple
lines
*/
----

=== Example (Hello world)

.Example 1
[source,cpp]
----
include::{source_dir}/ex21_en.c[]
----

- `#include` - directive for including external libraries
- `stdio.h` - library for accessing standard input/output streams (keyboard/screen)
- `printf` - function for printing on the standard output (screen)

=== Program for summing two integers

.Example 2 
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/ex22_en.c[]
----

== Variables

* Variables are symbolic names for places in memory where are stored some values.
* Before using it, each variable must be *declared*.
* With each assignment of new value, the old value in the variable is lost.

=== Declaring variables

----
data_type variable_name = initial_value;
----

.Example
[source,c]
----
int a = 5;
float x = 2.3;
char c = 'a';
----

=== Data types in C

[options="header",cols="^,^,^"]
|===
| Integers | Characters | Real numbers
| `int`       | `char`   | `float`
| `short`     |          | `double`
| `long`      |          |
|===

=== Defining variable names

In naming variables you can use:

* lowercase letters from `a` to `z`;
* uppercase letters from `A` to `Z`;
* digits from `0` to `9` (the name can not start with digit);

TIP: When choosing a variable name, pick ones that clearly describe the value they store.

WARNING: С is *case sensitive*

== Named constants

Names constants are created using the keyword `const`

.Example 3
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/ex23_en.c[]
----

Named constants can be created also by using 
the preprocessor and with all uppercase letters
by convention.

Using `#define`

`#define TEXT_TO_SEARCH_FOR REPLACEMENT_TEXT`

.Example 4
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/ex24_en.c[]
----


== Printing on the standard output

For printing on the standard output (screen) in C we use the 
function `printf` from the library `stdio.h` (**St**andar**d** **I**nput **O**tput) 

`#include <stdio.h>`

The signature of the function is:

`int printf(control_array, list_of_arguments)`

The _control array_ contains text of any kind, and format placeholders
with leading `%` or special characters with leading `\`.

The _format placeholders_ are determined from the variable type we want
to print.

=== Most used format placeholders

[options="header",cols="^,3"]
|===
| Format | Usage
| `%d`   | integers (`int`)
| `%i`   | integers (`int`)
| `%f`   | real numbers (`float`, `double`)
| `%c`   | characters (`char`)
| `%s`   | characters (стринг, `char[]`, `char*`)
| `%%`   | character `%`
|===

=== Usage of function `printf`

Print on the standard output the following sentences:
----
First sentence.
Second sentence.
Third sentence.
----

.Example 5
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/ex25_en.c[]
----

.Example 6
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/ex26_en.c[]

== Operators

=== Arithmetic operators

Are used on numbers (integers or real)

[options="header",cols="^,3"]
|===
| Operator | Operation
| +        | Addition
| -        | Subtraction
| *        | Multiplication
| /        | Division
| %        | Modulo (residue after division)
|===

== Problems

=== Problem 1

Write a program that will compute the value of the mathematical expression:
`x = 3/2 + (5 – 46*5/12)`

.Solution 1
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p21.c[]
----

=== Problem 2

Write a program that for given value of `x` (during the declaration)
will compute and print the value of `x^2^`.

.Solution 2
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p22_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 3
Write a program that for a given sides of one triangle, it will print the
perimeter and area squared (values are `a = 5`, `b = 7.5`, `c = 10.2`).

.Solution 3
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p23_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 4

Write a program for computing the arithmetic mean of the numbers 3, 5 and 12.

.Solution 4
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p24_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 5

Write a program that will print the remainder from the 
division of number 19 with 2, 3, 5 and 8.

.Solution 5
[source,c]
