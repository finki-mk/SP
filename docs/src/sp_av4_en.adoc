== Problems

=== Problem 1

Write a program that will print the maximum of two number read from SI.

.Solution `p4_1a.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p4_1a.c[]
----

.Solution b – without if-else `p4_1b.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p4_1b.c[]
----

=== Problem 2

Write a program that checks if given year read from SI is leap or not and prints out a appropriate message.

.Example leap years
1976, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012...

TIP: The year is leap is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or divisible by 400

.Solution `p4_2_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p4_2_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 3

The coordinates of a point are read from SI. 
Write a program that will print out the quadrant or the axis where the point belongs. 
If the point lays on the origin, print out a appropriate message.

. _Does this program cover all the cases?_

. _Will it print anything for any given point?_   


.Solution (c) `p4_3c_en.c`
[source,c]
----

----

=== Problem 4 

Write a program that will generate and print the grade according to the following table:

[options="header"]
|===
| Points    | Grade
| `0-50`    | 5
| `51-60`   | 6
| `61-70`   | 7
| `71-80`   | 8
| `81-90`   | 9
| `91-100`  | 10
|===

.Solution (a) `p4_4a_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p4_4a_en.c[]
----

.Solution (b) `p4_4b_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p4_4b_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 5

Change the previous program, so the sign of the number should be printed (+/-) depending on the last digit of the points number:

[options="header"]
|===
| last digit    | prints
| `1 - 3`       | -
| `4 - 7`       | `<blank_space>`
| `8 - 0`       | +
|===

.example
----
81 = 9-
94 = 10
68 = 7+
----

NOTE: For grade 5 doesn't add + or –, and for grade 10 should not add +.

.Solution `p4_5_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p4_5_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 6

Read from standard input three numbers in arbitrary order. 
The numbers are lengths of triangle sides. 
Write a program that will check if triangle can be constructed from given lengths, if so, then should check if the triangle is right triangle and compute its area.
On contrary, appropriate messages should be printed.

.Solution `p4_6_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p4_6_en.c[]
----

=== Problem 7

Write a program for simple calculator. 
The program reads two numbers and operator in format:

`num1 operator num2`

After the operation, depending on the operator, the result should be printed in format:

----
num1 operator num2 = result
----

.Solution `p4_7_en.c`
[source,c]
----
include::{source_dir}/p4_7_en.c[]
----

== Try these problems at home

=== Problem 1

For three segments read from SI, the program should check if a triangle can be formed, then print the kind.

=== Problem 2 *

For given center of circle and it's radius the program should determine the quadrants it is overlapping.
