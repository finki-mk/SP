=== Problem 1a

Write a program that computes the sum of all even two-digit numbers. 
Print the result on standard output.

=== Problem 1b

Write a program that computes the sum of all odd two-digit numbers. 
Print the result on standard output in the following format:

=== Problem 6

Write a program that for unknown count of integers read from SI will find the number with maximum value. 
The program stops when the reading of integer fails.

=== Problem 7

Write a program that for unknown count of integers read from SI will find the number with maximum value. 
Numbers larger than 100 should be ignored. 
The program stops when the reading of integer fails.

.Solution

=== Problem 8

Write a program that for unknown count of integers read from SI will find the two with maximum values.

.example
For the numbers 2 4 7 4 2 1 8 6 9 7 10 3 the program should print 10 and 9.

.Solution
[source,c]
----

----

=== Problem 9

Write a program that for N integers read from SI will the difference of the sums of numbers on odd and even positions (by the order of reading). 
If this difference is less than 10 print the message `"The two sums are close"` else print `"The two sums are far"`.

.example
For numbers:

_2_ *4* _3_ *4* _2_ *1* _1_ *6* _1_ *7*

_sum_odd_positions_ = 9

*sum_even_positions* = 22

Will print: 
----
The two sums are far
----
